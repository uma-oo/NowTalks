## Overview
This project is a single-page web application for a real-time forum built with Go, SQLite, Ja vaScript, HTML, and CSS. It supports user registration/login, post creation, commenting, and private messaging with real-time updates via WebSockets. The application ensures secure authentication, efficient data handling, and a responsive user interface without using frontend frameworks.

## Features
- **Registration and Login**:
  - Users register with nickname, age, gender, first name, last name, email, and password.
  - Login using nickname or email with password.
  - Logout available from any page.
- **Posts and Comments**:
  - View posts in a feed.
  - Comment on posts, visible only when viewing a specific post.
- **Private Messages**:
  - Real-time chat with online/offline user status.
  - Chat list sorted by last message (or alphabetically for new users).
  - Load last 10 messages, with scroll-up to fetch 10 more (throttled scrolling).
  - Messages display sender's nickname and timestamp.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - WebSockets for instant message notifications and chat updates.
- **Single Page Application**:
  - One HTML file with dynamic content managed by JavaScript.
- **Security**:
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
  - Session management with cookies.

## Technologies
- **Backend**:
  - Go (standard library + allowed packages: gorilla/websocket, sqlite3, bcrypt, google/uuid).
  - SQLite for data storage.
  - WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **Frontend**:
  - Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and WebSocket handling.
  - HTML (single file for SPA).
  - CSS for styling.
- **No frontend frameworks** (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) are used.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Go (version 1.21 or higher)
- SQLite3
- A modern web browser

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
2. **Run the Go application**:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh
   ```
   The server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Register a new account or log in to access the forum.

## Usage
- **Registration/Login**:
  - On the landing page, choose to register or log in.
  - Fill in the registration form with required fields (nickname, age, gender, first name, last name, email, password).
  - Log in using nickname or email and password.
- **Posts**:
  - Create a post with a title, content, and category from the feed page.
  - Click a post to view its content and comments.
  - Add comments to posts.
 â€”, **Private Messages**:
  - View the chat list (online/offline users) on the sidebar, sorted by last message or alphabetically.
  - Click a user to load the last 10 messages.
  - Scroll up to load more messages (throttled to prevent spam).
  - Send messages, which appear instantly for both users via WebSockets.
- **Logout**:
  - Click the logout button (available on all pages) to end the session.

## Development Notes
- **Backend**:
  - Uses Go routines and channels for concurrent WebSocket handling.
  - SQLite stores all data (users, posts, comments, messages).
  - Sessions are managed with cookies and UUIDs.
- **Frontend**:
  - JavaScript handles dynamic page updates (SPA) without reloading.
  - WebSocket client listens for real-time message updates.
  - Throttle/debounce used for scroll events to optimize message loading.
- **Database**:
  - Tables: `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `messages`, `sessions`.
  - Foreign keys ensure data integrity.
- **Security**:
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
  - Input validation prevents SQL injection and XSS.

## Allowed Packages
- Go standard library
- github.com/gorilla/websocket
- golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
- github.com/google/uuid
- SQLite3 (via database/sql)
